# **What is this Project?**

This project demonstrates my understanding of Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. I created a Pandas data frame that stores the number of M&Ms for each M&M color. Then, I used Pandas and Numpy to create a new row that contains the subtotal for each M&M color. Using the same process, I made another row to count the total number of M&Ms.

Then, I created a visual for the table of the M&M data using Matplotlib. I made a bar graph of the subtotal row of the M&M colors, ranging from greatest to least. I also created a pie chart of the subtotals.

# Libraries Needed

- **Matplotlib:** A plotting library used to visualize data.

```powershell
pip install matplotlib
```

- <span style="color: #ececec;">Numpy: Has support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It also has many high-level mathematical functions to operate on Numpy arrays.</span>

```powershell
pip install numpy
```

- <span style="color: #ececec;">**Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and for storing data.</span>

```powershell
pip install pandas
```
